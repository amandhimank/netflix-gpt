# useRef Hook
- Suppose there is a input box and i want to know what is written inside it, so for that i would need a reference to that input field and that reference is created using useRef that is provided by react.

        const email = useRef(null);
            -> Here, null => initial value

- Now, to get reference of the email input field in above email variable, we have to add an attribute to the input field.
  That attribute is "ref".

        <input ref={email} />
            -> Here, we are making "email" variable as the reference to this input box.

- reference is an object that contains "current" field and this current field contains the "value" field inside the input box.
